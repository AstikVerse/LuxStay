## How to Run Locally

1.  **Install Dependencies**  
    Open your terminal in this folder and run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the App**  
    Run:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Then open the link shown (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Troubleshooting
- If you see `'vite' is not recognized`, it means you skipped Step 1 (`npm install`).
- If you see `process is not defined`, ensure you are using the updated `vite.config.ts`.
